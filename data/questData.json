When I first pick up this quest at level 14, little did I know this huge defias brotherhood quest will span all the way to low level 30s. So here it goes:chapter 1 - The Defias BrotherhoodURL: https://classicdb.ch/quest=65comments: This is the first 5 steps of the series. Most of quests are delivery type. Nevertheless, you'll need to take out a messenger in this chapter. Very easy overall. At the end of 5th step, you need to escort a defias traitor through moonbrook (see chapter 2). The traitor is found at the bottom of the tower where Stoutmantle stands. The traitor should have a yellow exclaimation mark on top of his head by now. If you don't see an exclaimation mark, someone is probably escorting him so just wait patiently for your turn. Traitor respawns pretty fast. Chapter 2 - The Defias BrotherhoodURL: https://classicdb.ch/quest=155comments: This chain with the same quest name has only 2 parts. The 2nd part is to kill Edwin VanCleef, the end boss of Deadmines. Once killed VC, you can loot from his body an unsent letter, which begins the chapter 3 of this series. Both quests of this charpter require challenging fights. So bring some friends.Chapter 3 - Unsent Letter URL: https://classicdb.ch/quest=373comments: pretty straightforward. By the end of this chain, you'll begin chapter 4. You'll also need to go to stockades during this charpter. No doubt, stockades is the highlight of this chapter.Chapter 4 - The Attack!URL: https://classicdb.ch/quest=434comments: also straightforward. This is the last chapter of the whole defias brotherhood series. You'll need to take out 2 lv30-31 together. 19 quests, 2 instances. not bad huh? :) By my count, only 5 quests require killing, 14 delivery quests? o_0",

He then walks along the Old Coast Road until he gets near the Gold Coast Quarry, then runs down the ravine into the Quarry to a spot fairly far in, but not the very back. This is one of the two times he runs, the other being when low on health. And yes, he hauls butt, even when critical.Anyways, after that he walks back out and up the road to the Jangolode mine, and into the back of there and back out. Time spent in the Quarry is less than 2 minutes, in the Mine a bit upwards of 3. Assuming he hasn't died yet, he then ambles back south down the same route he took up, until a point somewhere between Moonbrook and the Quarry. At this point he seemed to just be travelling back and forth over a small section of road, until someone came up and killed him. I'd been tracking him for more spawns than I care to recall, so I stopped at that point. Oh, the respawn time is about 4 and a half minutes, usually.He's fairly easy to kill, nothing special about him. But feel free to group with anyone else with the quest, everyone in the group that kills him will be able to loot the message. The respawn is short, but why waste the time?Edit: Just occured to me, he won't attack you on sight. You can walk right next to him, and he'll ignore you. I'm pretty sure he won't even assist other Defias, but I could be wrong.Edited, Sun Feb 27 22:06:22 2005",

And really, who doesn't enjoy the visceral pleasure of wading through a murloc village, killing everything that moves, and stealing all that pitiful junk they so carefully ensconce in their treasure chests? I love the murloc treasure chests. Sometimes you get a pearl or something but usually its the WoW equivalent of the crap your six-year-old brother keeps in a shoebox under his bed.Anyway, the Westfall Stew quest is pretty cool and recipe alone is worth the time it takes to complete the quest.&nbsp",

Bear in mind that as the drop rate increases, so does the level of the mobs you're going to have to kill.If you run out of bag space mid-quest and return to sell off some junk, SELL CAREFULLY.  Every item here WILL sell to a vendor and if you're not careful, you'll end up having to re-farm everything for it.**Important!**  While farming the Okra from the reapers, save the hops for a quest turn-in at Grimbooze Thunderbrew!  He'll give you a Keg of Thunderbrew Lager, which is a quest item for Dry Times, a quest in Darkshire.  This is a great way to save time later, just remember - don't sell it or drink (all) of it!",
